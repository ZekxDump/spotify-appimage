Appimages for Spotify(until Spotify provides a official one)


PLEASE NOTE: In general, you should download AppImages only from the original authors of the software [here](https://spotify.com), but since they are not yet providing one I made this one for my use. Please contact them if you would like to see an official one. Running applications from random third parties is a security risk.  Always get your applications straight from the original authors, and only run applications the authors of which you really trust.
